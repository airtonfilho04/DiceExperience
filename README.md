# DiceExperience
## Solution Summary
The solution consists of a console program, which through the user's input "1" continues to roll the dice or terminates the program with another input.


The solution contains two main classes, the Dice class which defines the die and the Roller class which contains the roll method and statistical control.

## Statistics Control
Statistic control to decrease the stats of a number that is being called repeatedly is done through a roulette method. Where the number of times the number of dice came out is stored in memory, so that the more a number came out, the lower its percentage in "roulette", making it have less chance compared to the others. In the figure below, for example, we identified that the number 4, which has the lowest percentage on the roulette, is the number that was most drawn on the dice.
